    When an interviewer once asked communication and media theorist Marshall McLuhan about what radio is and could be, McLuhan expressed how <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/radio-today/">“youngsters use it as a space-maker, to create their own little space bubbles; to create a private world for themselves.”</a><br>
<br>
Although here McLuhan mainly meant to point out how they are able to “enclose [themselves] in auditory space”, radio can indeed be seen as a space-maker on many levels. Radio can connect and transport you to another place as a listener, carve out space for those matters that deserve more attention and help build and foster a sense of community. <br>
<br>
In this workshop you will dive into the world of radio, from the conceptual (how to create a show?), to the visual (how to represent this auditory thing graphically?) and the technical (how to set-up a broadcast – and what do all those buttons do?), and create your own space bubbles.
