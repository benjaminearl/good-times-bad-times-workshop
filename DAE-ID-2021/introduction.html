    When in 1973 Marshall McLuhan was asked about what radio is and could be, the communication and media theorist expressed how <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/radio-today/">“youngsters use it as a space-maker, to create their own little space bubbles; to create a private world for themselves.”</a><br>
<br>
Although here McLuhan mainly meant to point out how they are able to “enclose [themselves] in auditory space”, radio can indeed be seen as a space-maker on many levels. Radio can connect and transport you to another place as a listener, carve out space for those matters that deserve more attention and help build and foster a sense of community. <br>
<br>
From developing a concept for a show to producing audiovisual supporting elements (promo material + jingles!) and finding out how to technically set up a broadcast, in this workshop you will learn everything you need to create a place on the airwaves of DAE's <a href="http://elevatorradio.network">Elevator Radio</a> for the Information Design department.
