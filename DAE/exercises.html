      → Exercises<br><br>
      Exercise 1: <i>One Minute Recording</i><br>
      Bring a one minute sound recording to class on Monday.<br><br><hr><br>
      Exercise 2: <i>Thinking Through Talking</i><br>
      Every week Good Times Bad Times come up with a radio show idea, sometimes one hour before the show. We would write topics up on a board in our kitchen and then see which topic sparked the most conversation. <br><br>

      Radio creates a space for focussed conversation, we are going to use these sound clips as starting points for deeper discussion. Split up into groups of two. Interview each other for 15 min with a phone voice recorder on how your clips could be
      a starting point for a show.
      <br><br><hr><br>
      Exercise 3: <i>Listening As Editing</i><br>
      Listening is a fundamental skill of hosting a radio show. Listening while keeping a conversation going is a skill not easily earned but the process itself can be a source of ideas through misunderstanding and collaborative navigation.
      <br><br>
      Send your recordings of these conversations to another pair in the group. Once you receive somebody elses recordings, listen through and try to extract a core idea from it to develop into a 5min sketch for a show. This could be a music show,
      some experimental recordings interviews, a play, anything.
