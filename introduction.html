      → Introduction<br><br>
      Throughout recent history, radio has been used to transcend economic, social and political barriers. It's been used as a tool for emancipation, knowledge sharing and community building. From supporting civil rights movements to spawning new genres of music, radio has the potential to empower and unite people through common causes. The simplicity and accessibility of radio has produced a do-it-yourself ethos surrounding the medium and has fostered thousands of independent stations all over the world. This network of stations allows for connections to be made beyond locales, borders and cultures.<br><br>
      In the Netherlands, independent stations have been producing radio at art schools and institutions at an increasing rate in recent years. Stations such as Ja Ja Ja Nee Nee Nee, Radio Rietveld, PUB, Phantom Radio and Mushroom Radio have been set up independently and are now integral parts of the communities that surround them. Whilst each station functions differently, they all provide a platform for amplifying voices, sharing knowledge and connecting with others. Due to the collaborative aspect of radio-making, interconnections are often made between these stations that foster a sense of collectivity.<br><br>
      Besides a platform for sonic experimentation or showcasing anything audio-based, radio
      provides a concentrated space for discussion and reflection, due to its purely auditory
      nature. Focusing on language through one sense only, thoughts unfold linearly on both
      the producing and receiving end of the process. This contributes to the appeal of radio as
      opposed to other types of media where we are bombarded with visual prompts that distract
      from the message.<br><br>
      In this workshop we’ll learn more about why radio is an important medium and how it has continued to flourish by organising and putting together our very own radio station. Together we'll run through all stages of the setup, from the software and hardware, to organisation and production before broadcasting from your newly formed radio station.<br>
